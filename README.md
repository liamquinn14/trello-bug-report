## Cannot use tab navigation to create board

### Description

When using the dashboard, it is impossible to tab navigate to the 'create board' button. Perhaps it isn't actually a HTML button element. This makes it impossible for people with certain disabilities to use our product. If somebody with a screen reader, using tab navigation to select which buttons to press on our site, tries to use our product for its intended purpose, they will immediately exit the site and use a market competitor. We should prioritise this issue because accessibility should be a right rather than a privilege.

### Steps to Reproduce

On a signed in account, navigate to the dashboard. Keep pressing 'tab' until the cycle loops back to the top element. 

### Severity
